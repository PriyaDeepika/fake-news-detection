# Fake News Detection

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
Text data is cleaned and transformed using the **TF-IDF Vectorizer**, followed by a machine learning model to classify news as fake or real.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Clean and preprocess text data
3. Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF
4. Train a machine learning model for classification
5. Evaluate model performance

## Status
Initial version of the project. Further improvements and experiments will be added.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle:
